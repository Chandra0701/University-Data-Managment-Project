                        and postgraduate diplomas. They are sometimes used as steps on the route to a degree, as part of
                        the training for a specific career, or as a qualification in an area of study too narrow to
                        warrant a full degree course.

                <p>A library is a place where books and sources of information are stored. They make it easier for
                    people to get access to them for various purposes. Libraries are very helpful and economical too.
                    They include books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, manuscripts and more. In other words, they are an
                    all-encompassing source of information.</p>

                <h3>Largest Playground</h3>
                <p>A playground is a place where students can play. Typically, they have playthings for kids to use,
                    like
                    slides, swings, and seesaws. A playground can improve your pavement surface and make your kids enjoy
                    the playground more. Usually, they are outside, but occasionally, they are inside a building.</p>

                <h3>Tasty And Healthy Food</h3>
                <p>When we intake healthy fruits and vegetables that are full of nutrients, we reduce the chances of
                    diseases. For instance, green vegetables help us to maintain strength and vigor. In addition,
                    certain healthy food items keep away long-term illnesses like diabetes and blood pressure.</p>
